                <p class="hobbies">I've always enjoyed staying active, until September 2020 I use to play rugby and run every other day, I unfortunately had to stop due to a slipped disc within my back, and cannot be that active until I have completed my physio. (I also think I've enjoyed the kebab shop a bit too much since then!), I enjoy playing games with my friends, I love spending time with my daughter and watching her develop and learn as time goes on. I've always been intrested and intrigued by how things work, one of the reasons I decided to take the leap into my web development journey! </p>

                <p>I got my first job at 13, doing a paper-round, at 16 I started work at Mcdonalds as a crewmember, I stayed at Mcdonalds till I was 19 working my way up to a trainee shift manager. I then got a job at my local council which I am in presently. Accross all of these jobs it has taught me to be punctual and work to a great standard with outstanding work ethics. They have taught me to work well inside and outside of a team and even lead the team when I am needed to step up.</p>

                <p>I started learning web-development in the June of this year. I did this as I wanted a career change and have always been interested in the way things work and what needs to happen to get to the final product. So far I have learnt JS, HTML5 and CSS3. I am continuing to develop my skills by currently undertaking a react framework course. I have completed several projects which are available on my projects page.</p>
